[![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/SecretFox/Reauction/total)](https://github.com/SecretFox/Reauction/releases)  
Some auction house related tweaks.  
* Saves last selected item category and sorting order.
You can also configure it to save all search parameters by enabling "Save All" checkbox. When save all is enabled it also adds a "CLEAR" button that will reset all fields except for "Item Type".  
* It also shows each price on item sell prompt (ignoring tax reductions) and adds "Each" Column to buyview. 
* Fixes default searchfield that steals focus if you press shift after using it  

**Installation**  
Unzip to `..\Secret World Legends\Data\Gui\Custom\Flash\` folder.
